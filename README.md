# IOS
Want to build games for the iPhone and iPad? With SpriteKit, the graphics engine built into Xcode, and Swift, Apple's open-source programming language, you can quickly build complete, full-featured iOS games. In this course, Todd Perkins provides a simple introduction to SpriteKit: adding and modifying sprites, building relationships between parent and child sprites, and building the scenes where your content is housed. Then he shows how to add the physics, collisions, and actions to make sprites reactive during gameplay. Plus, learn how to add other features that enrich the gaming experience, such as audio, animation, particle effects, cameras, and realistic lighting.
Topics include:
Creating a new SpriteKit project
Adding and modifying sprites
Transitioning between scenes
Removing child sprites from parents
Working with gravity, forces, and impulses
Detecting collisions
Applying particle effects
Creating actions and action sequences
Working with audio
Creating frame animations
Using cameras and lights
